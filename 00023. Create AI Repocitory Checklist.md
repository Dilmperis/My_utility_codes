4) Key results or visuals – small GIF/image or plot showing output/prediction examples.
5) Architecture – simple block diagram or short paragraph explaining the model.

6) Dataset info :
    - Which dataset you used (e.g., MPI Sintel).
    - How to download it: (wget....)
    - Expected folder structure after extraction.
    - Any preprocessing/resizing steps.
