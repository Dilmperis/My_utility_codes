# Data (Re)Use Licenses STRATEGY:

Our research group employs a variety of licenses for data, code, theses, and publications, 
tailored to specific use cases and sharing needs. Below are the typical licenses used:

1. **Licenses for Data**
   - **CC BY 4.0 (Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International):**
     - For data, allowing modification and reuse for both non-commercial and commercial purposes, provided the data source is acknowledged.
2. **Licenses for Source Code**
   - **MIT License:**
     - For source code, permitting use, modification, and redistribution with minimal restrictions.

3. **Licenses for PhD Theses**
   - **CC BY-NC (Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial):**
     - For PhD theses, a CC-BY-NC license is used, preventing third-party commercial use while allowing sharing and modification with proper attribution.

4. **Licenses for Papers**
   - **IEEE Copyright or Similar:**
     - For papers, typically managed through publishers.

5. We have also considered another license or implementing a Data Sharing Agreement to replace a 
data (re)use license in specific scenarios. For code and data with valorization potential, 
stricter licenses such as the GNU General Public License (GPL), AGPL (Affero GPL), 
or EUPL (European Union Public License) have been considered. **In some cases, 
no sharing of the data and code has been contemplated to protect intellectual 
property and commercial opportunities.**
