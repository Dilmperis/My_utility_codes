This is a structured checklist to guide training an object detection model.

---
A) 
    1. batch size
    2. num_epochs
    3. lr (learning rate)
    4. include timing of training (tqdm does it also)
    5. (for Generalization): Data augmentation
    6. Losses/Eval Logging + Visualization 

B)  
    7. optimizer
    8. loss function (criterion)
    9. early stopping
    10. print evaluation metrics
    11. Split strategy (train/val/test)
    12. Checkpoint (saving): MAKE run file and add run_index fir each run.. 
        a) best model (according to val/test)
        b) every last epoch
