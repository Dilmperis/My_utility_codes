This is a structured checklist to guide training an object detection model.

---
A) 
    0. BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU STORE THE DATA: SSD ALWAYS!!! (with HDD its 10 x slower)
    1. batch size
    2. num_epochs
    3. lr (learning rate)
    4. include timing of training (tqdm does it also)
    5. (for Generalization): Data augmentation
    6. Losses/Eval Logging + Visualization 

B)  
    7. optimizer
    8. loss function (criterion)
    9. early stopping
    10. print evaluation metrics
    11. Split strategy (train/val/test)
    12. Checkpoint (saving): MAKE run file and add run_index fir each run.. 
        a) best model (according to val/test)
        b) every last epoch
    13. A good idea is to use all the hyperparameters as parser.arguments, and then save the command also in the loggings! 
        So that way you will know the results, but also how you got them.

        
        with open(log_path_of_txt_file, 'a') as f:
            f.write(f'command used: \n      python3 {" ".join(sys.argv)}\n')
